        "What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, \nI have forgotten, and what arms have lain \nUnder my head till morning; but the rain \nIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh \nUpon the glass and listen for reply, \nAnd in my heart there stirs a quiet pain \nFor unremembered lads that not again \nWill turn to me at midnight with a cry. \nThus in winter stands the lonely tree, \nNor knows what birds have vanished one by one, \nYet knows its boughs more silent than before: \nI cannot say what loves have come and gone, \nI only know that summer sang in me \nA little while, that in me sings no more.\n--Millay\n"
